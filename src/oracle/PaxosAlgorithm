• Paxos algorithm: (Lamport 1988 - Part tie parliament)

Problem         Assumptions     Paxos

Reliable computing systems out of unreliable component


CAP Theorem

Consistency , Availability, Partition Tolerance

write -> DB -> DB <- Read

Partition - sync between the DBs (DB node pods are not in sync due to network / hardware issues)
